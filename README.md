A music game I made in a group project in university

## About

In this game you control Sala the salamander, embarking on a musical adventure. Each level has a different theme, and flows from one to the next. Your objective is simple: survive to the end!

## Instructions

Simply use the mouse to move Sala. Avoid the various obstacles, which are generated such that they are in time to the music.

## Bugs & Other Notes

The game IS coded to start you at level 1 and then unlock subsequent levels as you play. However, because I am putting this up as a demo, I have left every level unlocked.

The obstacles in the 2nd stage (town) may not be properly timed to the music. I recommend skipping this stage.

The obstacles in the 4th stage may require you to be VERY fast and precise in your movements. We have beaten the game ourselves however, so it's not impossible.

## Credits

I did the bulk of the programming for the game, as well as designing how everything would work (obstacle movements, collision, obstacle spawning, etc.). My teammates were in charge of the audio, the UI, finding assets, and helped with level design. The full credits can be found in the level select.
